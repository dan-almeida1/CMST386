            <h2>Explain the ways to implement preprocessing (client-side vs server-side) (minimum 50 words).</h2>
            <p>Preprocessing can be implemented either client-side or server-side, depending on the requirements of the application.</p>
            <ul class="box">
                <li><strong>Client-side preprocessing</strong> involves performing data transformation or validation directly in the user's browser, often using JavaScript. This reduces server load and provides a faster response to users. It’s commonly used for tasks like input validation, image resizing, or form field adjustments.</li>
                <li><strong>Server-side preprocessing</strong> is done on the server before sending data to the client. This ensures greater control over data integrity, security, and processing. It’s typically used for more complex operations like data cleaning, aggregation, or applying business logic that requires more computational resources.</li>
